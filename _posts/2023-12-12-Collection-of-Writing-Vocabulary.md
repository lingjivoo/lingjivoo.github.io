# Collection of great vocabulary for paper writing


> 1 **on the fly**

> dynamically, while in motion or progress

>> example: During training, the two components incorporate the estimated depth to produce supervisory signals **on the fly**. (copy from [StructDepth](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Li_StructDepth_Leveraging_the_Structural_Regularities_for_Self-Supervised_Indoor_Depth_Estimation_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf))
 


> 2 **data starvation/ supervision starvationre**



> 3 **hinting at a possibility for**
> a hint to the possibility, provide a potential for 
>> example: In contrast, recent large language models exhibit a wide range of capabilities, **hinting at a possibility for** similarly versatile models in computer vision. (copy from [4M](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06647.pdf))
 

> 4 **out of box**
>  immediate usability (typically an electronic device or a piece of software), unusually good (the novel is nothing out of the box).
>> example: 4M leads to models that exhibit several key capabilities: (1) they can perform a diverse set of vision tasks **out of the box**. (copy from [4M](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06647.pdf))


> 5 **remarkable flexibility**
> can be used for describing controllability or editing,
>> example: enabling a wide variety of expressive multimodal editing capabilities with **remarkable flexibility**. (copy from [4M](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06647.pdf))



> 6 **The field has seen a shift towards**
> for the first paragraph in Introduction, the beginning of a storyline.
>> example: In recent years, **the field** of natural language processing (NLP) **has seen a shift toward**  training large language models (LLMs) that are inherently capable of performing a wide range of tasks without requiring extensive task-specific adaptations [12, 25]. (copy from [4M](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06647.pdf))


> 7 **there remains a need to**
> Translation in Introduction. Translation from previous works to problems/needs or our work. 
>> example: **While** these models have demonstrated remarkable success in NLP, **there remains a need to** develop similarly versatile and scalable models for vision.. (copy from [4M](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06647.pdf))



> 8 **delve into** 
> to try hard to find out more information about something.
>> In this report, we **delve into** the performance of LLMs within the context of scientific discovery/research, focusing on GPT-4 (copy from [Imapct of LLM on Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07361.pdf)).

> 9 **Broadly speaking**
> without regard to specific details or exceptions
>> example: Broadly speaking, we evaluate GPT-4’s knowledge base, scientific understanding, scientific numerical calculation abilities, and various scientific prediction capabilities (copy from [Imapct of LLM on Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07361.pdf)).


> 10 **transform the way**
>> examples: i)Transform The Way You Work, and ii) LLMs are capable of transforming the way we generate and process information (copy from [Imapct of LLM on Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07361.pdf)).


> 11 **transform the way**
>> examples: i)Transform The Way You Work, and ii) LLMs are capable of transforming the way we generate and process information (copy from [Imapct of LLM on Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07361.pdf)).

> 12 **extraordinary capabilities**
>> example: Because of its extraordinary capabilities in general AI tasks, GPT-4 is also garnering significant attention in the scientific community.


> 13 **central focus**
>> example: Our aim is to provide a broad overview of LLMs’ performance and their potential applicability in these specific scientific fields, with GPT-4, the state-of-the-art LLM, as our **central focus**.

> 14 **and beyond**
>> example: These strive to uncover the fundamental principles and laws governing the universe, spanning from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxies **and beyond**.

> 15 **a wide array of**
>> example: Natural science is an incredibly diverse field, encompassing **a wide array of** disciplines, including both physical sciences, which focus on non-living systems, and life sciences, which investigate living organisms.

> 16 **overlaps with**
> a part of the first thing occupies the same area as a part of the other thing.
>> example: It is important to note that these areas are not mutually exclusive; for example, drug discovery substantially overlaps with biology.


> 17 **by which**
> By which = How or whereby or “through which”
>> example:  Drug discovery is the process by which new candidate medications are identified and developed to treat or prevent specific diseases and medical conditions.


> 18 **on most fronts**
> of most aspects
>> example: outperform these methods on most fronts (copy from [3D Gaussian splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/3d_gaussian_splatting_low.pdf)).


> 18 **follow-up methods**
>> example: The success of NeRF has resulted in an explosion of follow-up methods that address quality and speed, often by introducing regularization strategies. (copy from [3D Gaussian splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/3d_gaussian_splatting_low.pdf)).


> 19 **equal**
>> example: We are able to equal or in some cases surpass this quality while providing fast training and real-time rendering. (copy from [3D Gaussian splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/3d_gaussian_splatting_low.pdf)).


> 20 **pave the way for the application of xx in**
>> example: 

> 21 **charting future research paths**
>> a multitude of studies have surfaced with the aim of **charting future research paths**, which have varied from identifying emerging trends to highlighting areas poised for swift progress.
