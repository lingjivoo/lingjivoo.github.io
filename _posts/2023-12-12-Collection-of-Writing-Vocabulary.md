# Collection of great vocabulary for paper writing


> 1. **on the fly**

> dynamically, while in motion or progress

>> example: During training, the two components incorporate the estimated depth to produce supervisory signals **on the fly**. (copy from [StructDepth](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Li_StructDepth_Leveraging_the_Structural_Regularities_for_Self-Supervised_Indoor_Depth_Estimation_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf))
 


> 2. **data starvation**


> 3. **hinting at a possibility for **
> a hint to the possibility, provide a potential for 
>> example: In contrast, recent large language models exhibit a wide range of capabilities, **hinting at a possibility for** similarly versatile models in computer vision. (copy from [4M](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06647.pdf))
 

> 4. **out of box**
>  immediate usability (typically an electronic device or a piece of software), unusually good (the novel is nothing out of the box).
>> example: 4M leads to models that exhibit several key capabilities: (1) they can perform a diverse set of vision tasks **out of the box**. (copy from [4M](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06647.pdf))

5. **remarkable flexibility**
> can be used for describing controllability or editing,
>> enabling a wide variety of expressive multimodal editing capabilities with **remarkable flexibility**.
